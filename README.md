### About
I like video games, particularly fighting games, but I have a lot of games and can't seem to remember the moves for them all. I have a lot of old/vintage video game systems that do not have built in moves lists. So I built an app to help me organize moves list for various fighting games.

The layout of the models in the app is simple. There are many games. Each game has many characters. Each character has many moves.

Without logging in one can view a list of all games in the app, each game's characters, and each character's moves. You cannot create, edit, or delete. Any attempt to do any of the 3 will get a redirect and an error message.

Once you log in you can create, edit, or delete.

This app is made to be desktop browser, tablet, and phone friendly. When on the tablet or phone, the navbar items will be in a drop down menu.

App is searchable and you can search for Game or Character. If the search query exists in all models, it will be displayed in the following order: Game, Character, and then Move. For any Game query result, it will display the Game title with the query highlighted and the whole text as a link to Game's characters index. For any Character query result, it will display the Character name with query highlighted and whole text as a link to Character's moves index. It will also have a link to the associated Game characters index.

During preproduction there was the ability to search for Move, but because for production I am using Heroku with add-on SearchBox Elasticsearch, at the free tier SearchBox only allows me to have 2 indices. With Move it would have been 3 indices and it caused the server to crash due to that limitation. Sacrifices had to be made.. =(

### To install
Make sure you have ElasticSearch installed. If you are on a Mac, use Homebrew:
```sh
$ brew install elasticsearch
```

Note: If you do not have Homebrew, installing Homebrew can break your existing Ruby install (it broke openssl for me) so reinstall Ruby after you install homebrew (use something like RVM to keep it simple). Also, if you do not have Java installed when installing ElasticSearch via Homebrew, just follow the onscreen instructions to install Java and then install ElasticSearch.

After ElasticSearch is installed follow instructions to start it.

To have launchd start ElasticSearch at login:
```sh
$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```
Load ElasticSearch now:
```sh
$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
```

Verify ElasticSearch install by going to ```localhost:9200``` You will see ElasticSearch version number and other stats.

Make sure you have the correct Ruby version. Check .ruby-version at root of the project or in the gemfile.

```sh
bundle install
rake db:setup
rails s
```

If you want to see how well the app displays on a tablet or phone, instead of launching the app via ```rails s``` you can launch it via ```rails s -b 0.0.0.0``` and from the tablet/phone navigate to the server's local network ip address:3000, something like this on the tablet/phone's browser: ```192.168.1.100:3000```

### To run tests
From the root of the project in console run: `$ rspec spec`.
